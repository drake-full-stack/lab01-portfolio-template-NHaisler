  <h2>Hobbies</h2>
  <p>
    There are a lot of things I enjoy doing, but here are two I'd like to highlight:
    <em>Art</em> and <em>Chess</em>.
  </p>

  <h3>Art</h3>
  <p>I don't spend as much time as I'd like making art, but it's something I enjoy a lot. Below are two pieces I made.</p>

  </p>

  <h3>Chess</h3>
  <p>
    Chess is something I got into in highschool. After Queens Gambit and COVID hit it blew up, and I have had a lot more oppurtunties to play with people because of it.
    <strong>Last year I played in my first tournament.</strong>
    I havent had time to compete since, but just like Art, I enjoy anytime spent with this hobby.
