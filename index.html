    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I'm 21 and a college student in my last year at Drake University. I spend a lot of time working on research and other projects.<br>
        My goal is to get a masters degree in Computer Science from Japan. Giving me a chance to spend time living in a different country.<br>
        Most of my skills are academic: coding, mathematics, and communication skills.
